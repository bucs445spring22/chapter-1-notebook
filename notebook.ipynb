    "        * One of the first data structures you were introduced to is an `int`\n",
    "        * Assuming you were working in a C based language, an `int` is a data structure that defines 32 bits as an integer in the range of 2^32 that can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided\n",

    "        * Quicksort is a fast sorting algorithm, but if you do not understand why, you may get worse complexity than bubble sort. Understanding the tradeoffs and why they exist is more important than memorizing the Algorithms \n",

    "            * technically, MVC isn't a design pattern\n",
    "    * Design Patterns are concerned with creating a system where changing component A does not force you to then alter component B, which then requires you to alter component C, etc...\n",

    "            2. modular\n",
    "                * each internal component has an associated data structure made up of other internal components or data.\n",
